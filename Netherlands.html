	<center><h1>The Netherlands</h1></center>

	<center><p> The Netherlands, informally known as Holland, has been a pillar for Europe for its existance. The Netherlands allowed women's suffrage in 1919, and it was the first country to legalise same-sex marriage in 2001. Windmills, tulips, clogs, and cheese have grown to symbolize the Netherlands, especially among tourists. </p> </center>
