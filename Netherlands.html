	<center><h1>The Netherlands</h1></center>

	<center><p> The Netherlands, informally known as Holland, has been a pillar for Europe for its existance. The Netherlands allowed women's suffrage in 1919, and it was the first country to legalise same-sex marriage in 2001. Diary of a Young Girl by Anne Frank is the most translated book from Dutch, and windmills, tulips, clogs, and cheese have grown to symbolize the Netherlands, especially among tourists. Netherlands literally means "lower countries" in reference to its low elevation and flat topography, with 26% below sea level.</p> </center>
