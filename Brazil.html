	<center><h1>Brazil</h1></center>

	<center><p> Brazil, officially the Federative Republic of Brazil, is the largest and easternmost country in South America. It is the world's fifth-largest country by area and the seventh-largest by population, with over 212 million people. In martial arts, Brazilians developed Capoeira, Vale tudo, and Brazilian jiu-jitsu. Capoeira is usually played with its own music referred to as capoeira music, which is usually considered to be a call-and-response type of folk music. Some famous figures in sports from Brazil are Pel√©, a footballer as well as sport figure of the 20th century, and Ayrton Senna, the driver with most consecutive wins and pole positions at the same Grand Prix of Formula One. </p> </center>
